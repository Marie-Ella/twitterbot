# twitterbot

This is a Twitter Bot than has been set up using javascript and node.js. It uses the twit npm package. The bot can be found here: https://twitter.com/eu_immigrant and it relies on a counter that is implemented here: http://igor.gold.ac.uk/~msegg002/counter/Counter.html
I created the bot as a university project and this bot https://twitter.com/trumptaxme inspired me.
The bot relies on an array of different phrases and a count function.

The bot can be found in the file bot3.js
To run the code you need the twit package and your twitter API keys (they have been retracted and put into a seperate config file by me that I haven't uploaded here).

The bot does not include an interval function, this is done by an Heroku add-on. The bot tweets every hour.
